Rosalind_Problems are problems are found at rosalind.info, a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving. The problems below deal with solving bioinformatics problems using python.


Geno_Pheno_Generator is an example of my research. This program randomly generates a genotype and phenotype based on genetics inputs of QTL Variance (the amount a trait varies in a population), the dominance-additivity ratio (the behavior of the heterozygote or how dominant the model is), and the increaser allele frequency (how common the trait is in a population). 


RNA_DNA_Converter will take an input of a DNA or RNA strand and convert it into its opposite.
